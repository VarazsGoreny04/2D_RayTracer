# RayCaster
The app has a 2D top view and a fake 3D camera view. The user can switch between them by clicking the conviniently named "***Show SceneObjects***" checkbox in the ImGui window.

In the ImGui window we can further specify the number of rays (***Ray count***), the position of the camera (***Position***), the facing direction in degrees (***Direction***) and the field of view (***FOV***). Also there is an option to use the mouse and keyboard to move through the scene.
- W  ->  Move forward
- S  ->  Move backward
- A  ->  Move left
- D  ->  Move right

To rotate the camera the user must hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse horizontally.
